     This program acts as an interface to the problems defined in the README.md:

     1. Does a user-agent string belong to a pre-defined group?

     2. What device could the user-agent be sent from?

     For the first problem, you'd call this program with two parameters:
     ./program -ua <some user-agent string> -group <some group>

     For the second problem, you'd call this program with one parameter only:
     ./program -ua <some user-agent string>

     Optionally, you can specify which format of the output you want:
     ./program ... -output application/json
