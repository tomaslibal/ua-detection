## Device detection

### Introduction

This is an experimental repository about device detection for the World Wide
Web. I am mostly interested in device detection for the user agents connecting
to web servers through the HTTP requests.

Two end goals that I would like achieve:

1. Determine if the device belong to a given group

   Say, you define a group 'Smart TVs' and you get a user-agent string, this
   detection tells if the string comes possibly from a device that belongs to
   the group or not.

2. Uniquely determine a device for a given user-agent string

   This detection tells what device(s) likely belong to the supplied user-agent
   string.
